*/


//expected output when loop terminates first = 10, second = 40


var first = 5;

var second = 0;


//while loop with two errors

while (first < 10) { // added parenthese and removed the quotaion marks

first;first++; //added  first ++ 

second += first;

}


//output with one error

console.log(first);

console.log(second);// added a lowercase s due to javescript being case sensative
